/// An object that represents Indirect Light which is used to simulate environment lighting, a form of global illumination.
/// Filament supports rendering with image-based lighting, or IBL.
/// This uses an environment map to approximate the lighting all directions.
/// Environment lighting has a two components:
/// irradiance  -  reflections (specular component)
/// Environments are usually captured as high-resolution HDR equirectangular images
/// and processed by the cmgen tool to generate the data needed by IndirectLight.
/// Currently IndirectLight is intended to be used for "distant probes",
/// that is, to represent global illumination from a distant (i.e. at infinity) environment,
/// such as the sky or distant mountains.
/// Only a single IndirectLight can be used in a Scene. This limitation will be lifted in the future.
/// Use the cmgen tool to generate the Spherical Harmonics for a given environment.
///
/// See also:
/// [KtxIndirectLight] : creates indirect light from ktx file.
/// [HdrIndirectLight] : creates indirect light from hdr file.
/// [DefaultIndirectLight] : creates indirect light from default parameters like intensity, irradiance ,etc.
///
/// Defaults to   [DefaultIndirectLight] with intensity = 30_000,
/// radianceBands = 1, radianceSh = [1,1,1], irradianceBands = 1, irradianceSh =[1,1,1]
